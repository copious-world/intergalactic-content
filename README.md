# intergalactic-content

Content exists independently of storage or even of a placement within some visual structure.

Content is interpretable with respect to semantic contexts. But, content remains consistent in structure - structure that it is relevant to a parsing mechanism.

Content may be at rest (stored) or it might be in motion, transmitted on a carrying signal.

Store of a many identifiable pieces of content may be called **repositories**. We could say that content float from one repository to another when some entity operates on the repositories so as to copy content from one to another, perhaps deleting it from its source.

> **Intergalatic-content** is content that floats freely among repositories but has idenitifyig features which may be used to associate it with fixed storage. In particular, a binary representation of may be parsed in such a way that the content may be hashed to produce a universally unique identifier, such as a sha256 hash.

## The Intergalactic Distinction

There are now a number of systems that are peer to peer **p2p** stores of content. For example, there is **IPFS** the **Interplanetary File System**, there is Bittorrent, etc. These systems provide file system processes for storing content. They are repositories. These systems associate identity with storage. In truth, the systems form identifiers for content by hashing content. But, they usually provide interfaces to programs that return the identifiers as a result of the act of storing the content. 

For **Intergalactic Content**, identity will be a structure that may refer to repository storage, but also that attempts to reveal identity for normalized binary representations and couples them with identifiers helpful in clustering conent for use in varying semantic contexts.

**Reduced Content Populations**: A UCWID is used for Intergalactic content identifiers. By using a normalized binary representation, there is an attempt to erase the creation of identifiers that are extremely distant in hash space when the actual binary content of differenced copies is extremely small.

**Minimal Distance for Rehashing**: With Intergalactic content, we recognize that a piece of content does not necessarily change until its semantic intent begins to change. We entertain a notion of keeping a single identifier, an originating identifier for a piece of content and group edits under its umbrella until some act of editing forces a split from the original.

## What is in the Repository

* A tool for helping a user make an identity
* Tools for operating on content
* Tools for keeping track of identities changes (edits)
